**Project name:** `ELO Analysis Tool`

#### Project idea

Users login using `Google Identity Platform` and we collect data from `lichess.org API`. Local session tokens are stored in our cache, all of the remaining data is stored in our `Amazon RDS` database. The main function of the solution is to collect results of matches within lichess.org Teams and calculating local ELO within the teams. After we've implemented this functionality we'll look into expanding the idea by analysing other data from the `lichess.org API` - such as analysing ELO growth by played matches, winrates of nation vs nation and other unexplored statistics and analysing tools.
